# Crime Analysis Report

## Project Objective
In this project, total crimes will be analysed by year, month and day. Insights into crime distribution over the year-over-year and month-over-month will also be analysed. Crime occurrences within specific time intervals will also be explored. Crime occurrences by country will also be categorised. Based on these analyses, the resolution rate of crimes and unresolved crimes will be highlighted. And the specific time periods during the day associated with a higher and lower frequency of crimes will be pinpointed.
